    <p>Hi, that's me , I woulad like to tell you about my free time.</p>
    <p>Lately I don't really have a lot of free time, but in my free teme I draw on paper or iPad.</p>
    <p>Before I danced a lot, I found my style finally, but I can't find good schedule.</p>
    <p>Also I play video games or sometimes read or watch YT.</p> 
    <p>In free time I don't do designs or animations, because I do it in my school (Computer graphic and animations) and it's enought for me^^</p>
